# Malware Explorer

This Rails application allows users to upload a .csv file describing malware and then view a report of the counts of malware according to their classification and type.

The import csv logic can be found under app/use_cases/malware_imports/import_malware.rb

Putting business logic in use cases keeps models and controllers nice and thin!

A sample csv file can be found in the /data directory

# CSV format

| MD5 | ClassificationName | ClassificationType | Size | FileType |
